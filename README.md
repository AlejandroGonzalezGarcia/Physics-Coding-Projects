# Physics-Coding-Projects
This is a repository consisting of relevant physics coding projects that I completed during PHYS 2030 - Computational Methods for Physicist and Engineers
Please not that not all exercises are included as many were repetitive and went over similar concepts as the one prior. With that said, only the most 
relevent projects are included.
